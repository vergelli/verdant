# Changelog

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- SavedVars now include `GetWorldName()` as namespace — EU, NA and PTS settings are kept separate for the same `@account`.
- Skill-color fill pools migrated from a hand-rolled pre-allocated table to `ZO_ObjectPool`, as recommended by ESOUI best practices.

### Changed
- Localization strings moved from a private `Verdant.L` table to the standard ESO `ZO_CreateStringId` / `GetString` pattern.
- Locale file renamed from `locales/en.lua` to `locales/default.lua`; manifest now also loads `locales/$(language).lua` so future community translations can be dropped in without touching the manifest.
